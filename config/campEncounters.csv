,"Wisdom Perception check DC12, the players hear the flapping of a large creature's wings. 1D4 vrock fly low past the camp, unless the adventurers do anything to attract attention they continue to fly past. If the adventurers attack or attract attention 1 Vrock will peel off to investigate."
,[setting up camp] A clumsy Gnome druid named Erp will ask to join the party at their fire and spend the night. He talks in his sleep and summons 2d4 + 2 poisonous snakes from the surroundings to join the camp. If the guard does not notice this the PCs may wake up with a snake or two in and under their sleeping bags. The druid does not wake up in the morning and a medicine check reveals he was bitten and has been paralysed for several hours. Doing this medicine check also provokes the responsible snake to come out of hiding and attempt to defend its master. In the stuff of the druid there are 2 potions of antidote (with the side effect of not being able to talk/speak for 1d4+1 hours) and 3 home-made healing potions.
,"The giant frogs here are obnoxious at night. Their croaking prevents anyone from sleeping that does not make a wisdom save dc 15, gaining them exhaustion for not sleeping. Killing at least half a dozen will shut them up for a bit and gets you advantage on your save to fall asleep. In the morning 2d4 +1 will hop into camp in search for food, they are initially not hostile but will rummage through their stuff and are hard to chase away."
,"[Setting up Camp]
You see the ruins of a small fortress at the top of a small hill. A history check might reveal it once was an outskirt guard post meant to protect this road. At dusk, a ghost appears but it seems harmless, it is pacing in a small part of the ruins and mumbling to himself, he can not be interacted with in any meaningful sense. An hour before midnight he sinks on his knees and seems to be praying and wailing. At 10 to twelve he will walk into the former courtyard, climb imaginary stairs, and at 12 precisely he seems to drop flailing as he hangs by an invisible noose. All the PCs will make wisdom saves or will feel a noose around their neck that is not there and they will start suffocating where they stand or sleep. PCs can be saved by a wisdom save every round or by dragging themselves out of the ruins. Six rounds later the ghost hangs limp for the remainder of the night and the struggle stops, at dawn he disappears."
,In the night two will-o-wisp drift across to the camp and attack
,"1 goblin boss with 1d6 goblins attack the camp, they attempt to sneak up before raiding"
,"An elf on horseback passes by the camp. Their horse has large saddlebags. They set up a telescope on a nearby hill or clearing and angle it into the sky observing the cosmos. If they are engaged in conversation they will ask the adventurers if they want to look. If the adventurers look they see the red star and must roll a wisdom saving throw DC 5. If they fail they experience short term madness. If they look again the DC increases by 5. The stargazing elf says “It captures the mind if you look for too long. When I was a child there was no red star. I’ve watched the stars every night every night I’ve been an adult, it appeared during my second century, so faint I wasn’t sure I hadn’t missed it before. Now its the brightest star in the night sky. An ill omen I think.” He’ll go back to his telescope.
If the adventurers do note engage him in conversation he will instead go mad."
,those on watch witness a brilliant shooting star and gain inspiration.
,"A small native animal (goat) approaches. If the PCs are kind to it, it reveals itself to be a wildshaped druid, and casts a beneficial spell (heroes feast). If they are unkind it reveals itself to be a druid and casts a detrimental spell (wrath of nature). It then leaves."
,"The party settles in. In the morning, they discover they're inexplicably twenty miles closer to their destination then they thought."
,One of the watchers notice a small fire through the woods. If the PCs go to investigate they find a small band of outlaws who will share their meat and mead if the PCs act civilized
,"During the night, dark clouds gather and heavy rain starts to fall. Everything gets soaked and cold and each PC without a tent must make a survival check to fashion a shelter or a con save DC 15 on failure they are sickened for 1d4 days."
,"The party's campsite is on top of some ancient ruin. If their combined weight gets to or surpasses a certain limit they fall through the roof. They could climb out, but the kobolds inside have a prophecy that their gods will fall from the sky. The party will be treated like royalty, but hopefully learn that the kobolds prophecy involves consuming their god as well."
,"An enterprising band of rats begin gnawing through the bags containing the party's food supplies. Spell component pouches are also viable targets. If those on watch fail several subsequent Perception checks, the party finds part of its stores gone and risk filth fever if they consume the rest before using purify food and drink."
,At some point in the night kobolds/goblins or other minor monster sneak in and try to steal the party's horses. They flee if confronted.
,"The ghost of a person murdered on the site manifests. It asks the party to give its bones a proper burial so it can rest. If the party complies, it shows them the location of a common magic item lost nearby e.g. coin of delving or clockwork amulet. If they refuse, it attacks."
