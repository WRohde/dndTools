subtable,"1 human thug per PC is disguised as a cloaked traveler traveling along the road, wisdom (Perception) DC15 to recognise that these travelers are wearing armour, or armed. 
When the players are 60ft away from the thugs they will throw off their cloaks, shout “drop your weapons” and ready their heavy crossbows to fire at the PC’s if they do not comply."
subtable,"1 dwarf thugs per PC are stood by a barricade built across the road (30HP damage threshold 5, 15AC). They will demand a toll of 1GP per character to pass on the road, otherwise the party is free to pass through in the field. If the party doesn’t pay the toll and passes too close to the barricade the thugs will attack with their ranged weapons but not leave their posts."
subtable,"The players come across 3D4 Thugs in combat with 2D4 Guards and 1 veteran officer, the thugs have the upper hand. What will the players do?"
,"Two merchants come up with their cart. They have some minor magic items such as an ever-clean cloak pin, and a cloak of protection against cold. If players buy something they get a weird wooden stick for free, the two brothers know it is magical but they don’t know what it does. If they take it, the brothers, who are serial killers (assassins), will track them and at dusk they will activate the stick, which functions as an explosive rune (glyph of warding) with a smoke effect. They will attempt to take down the strongest character in the group first."
,"A raging mad halfling (barbarian) is found sitting on the road, he will scratch, stab, bite, and jump people that come within 10ft of him and doesn’t stop screaming about some bastard who he killed that took his mind and cursed him. If he is killed his eyes will grow clear and he will thank you with his last words before closing his eyes in peace.
The PC that delivered the killing blow is now cursed, taking over the curse this halflinghad. From now on, after every long rest the PC must make a wisdom saving throw DC 12 or get a new madness from the long-term madness table but loses the madness that it had previously until he/she him is killed or the curse is lifted."
,"A fallen tree lies across the road, with a perception check DC10 the party can note it is suspicious there are no trees by the road (nor a stump), DC20 they can see that there are peepholes in the tree and people are watching them. If the adventurers get within 30ft of the log they are attacked by a group of bandits, they are Goblin rogues , two of which jump out of the log and fire a surprise attack (sneak attack damage if undetected +2D6) with light crossbows (1D8) at the adventurers before demanding the players packs and coin purses. The goblins will continue their attack unless the adventurers comply. 

If the players allow the goblins to escape they will run to the nearest encampment"

It appears to be a ring with an embedded gem, or  a jewel studded longsword.
