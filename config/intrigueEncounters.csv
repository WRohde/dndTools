,"Meet Vavier, an artisan, a painter. He is painting the local scenery and he
seems to do a pretty good job, a scruffy dog lays lazy at his feet and a pendant of an orb with many eyes hangs around his neck. For 35 gold pieces he will make a portrait of a PC, this will take 6 hours and the PC may choose one object to be depicted, a pose, and one fictional thing to change from reality. This painter is talented and supported by Savras, as a cruel cosmic twist of fate it is now up to the DM to make a reality of this painting 3 times, but in twisted ways.

When (if) it is taken two shadows and a spectre emerge from graves and attack."
