1,"Pass by a group of 1D8 travelers heading in the opposite direction to the players, if the players interact they can provide basic information on where the players are heading, offer to hire the players as guards for their journey to the next down in their direction (back where the players came from), or to sell travel supplies (anything from the explorer and dungeoneer packs from starting equipment) to the players."
2,"A trade caravan transporting goods between towns with 1D4 coachmen, covered wagons and horses pass by the group. There will also be one guard and one veteran per wagon (Veteran stat block). 
They will refuse to trade with the adventurers and the guards will react gruffly to any attempt to delay them.

If a character is part of the Heth Plateau Merchants Guild (HPMG) and can demonstrate membership, the trade caravan will respond in a more friendly way, they will still refuse trade but will not mind delaying to discuss things with them. 

If the players attempt to hijack the wagons roll in the … for the contents of the wagons.

7,"An older halfling and a younger gnome (commoners) sit on the side of the road, they are giggling while they are smoking something from a broad pipe. They seem to be quite out of it and giggle about the PCs that come past. If any of the party have any form of illusionary/glamour magic they will see right through it and comment on it inappropriately. The older halfling will offer the party to buy some while the younger gnome shushes him while giggling, for 5 gold pieces they get a dose of willoweed. \nSmoking a dose of willoweed (takes two minutes) will get you advantage on seeing through illusions and you don’t need to be aware of any effect to receive a roll for it. It also makes you giggle, and feel totally safe regardless of attacks or other hostile actions around you, providing the effects of a calm emotions spell where you are indifferent to the creatures you are aware of when you take the dose for 10 minutes."
8,"A postal messenger passes the group, they ride a horse with two leather saddlebags full of post and are accompanied by 1D4-1 guards on horses. The players can give them a letter to post for 2cp per mile, it will take 1D4days per every 60 miles to deliver the letter."
